## Roblox Username Generator

This is a Python script that generates random Roblox usernames and checks if they are available on the platform. Valid usernames are saved to a text file for later use.

## Usage

1. Install Python 3.x on your computer if it's not already installed.
2. Download the `generator.py` file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `generator.py` file is located.
4. Run the script using the command `python generator.py`.
5. Enter the number of checks you want to perform when prompted.
6. The script will generate and check usernames, displaying whether they are valid or not. Valid usernames will be saved to a text file named `usernames.txt`.

Note: The script adds a delay of 0.1 seconds between each username check to avoid overwhelming the Roblox server.
